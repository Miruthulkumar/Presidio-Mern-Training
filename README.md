# MERN To-Do App (Learning Project)

This is a **learning project** where I am building a To-Do application using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).  

Currently, I am working on the **backend** (API for managing tasks), and I plan to add a **frontend** in the future.  

## Features (Backend so far)
- Create a new task  
- Get all tasks  
- Update a task  
- Delete a task  

## Tech Stack
- **MongoDB** – Database  
- **Express.js** – Backend framework  
- **Node.js** – Runtime environment  
- **React** – (Will be added later for frontend)  

## Purpose
This project is mainly for **learning full stack development using MERN**.  

## Future Plans
- Add a frontend with React  
- Improve UI/UX  
- Deploy the app

✨ Still learning and building step by step!
